# RandomNumberGame
RandomNumberGame is a project that utilizes interaction between the user and the console. As the game starts, the program will create a four-digit "code" that the user will attempt to guess. While checking the user's input the porgram will also check for numbers that are a part of the generated code, but not in the correct position. The program will keep track of these values both, "correct" and "misplaced", and will display them to the user. After the twelfth unsuccesful guess, the main game will end as a loss for the user and output the secret code. The game will then prompt the user to either continue playing or terminate the program entirely.
## Components
The program utilizes functions to operate the logical flow of the game.
